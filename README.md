# lightweb

This little node server serves a page that allows Bluetooth control of a strip of LEDs directly from your browser.

## Requirements

- A browser with Web Bluetooth capabilities.  Chrome, yes. Safari, no. Firefox, no. as of 2/2018
- A Bluetooth LEB control available from a site coming soon.
- A device that has Bluetooth BLE enabled.  

As far as devices that can run a browser with Web Bluetooth, I know the MacBook Pro Mid-2015 running Chrome are capable.

## Usage

Clone this tiny repo.
cd lightweb
node lightweb.js

Browse to localhost:14000
